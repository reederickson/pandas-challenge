I made use off office hours, as well as attended an incredibly useful tutoring session with Kourt Bailey. He went through my code with me and helped me work out some bugs, as well as suggest ways to make my code more cohesive. I had been struggling with pushing to my git hub through the terminal and he showed me the proper way to do so.
